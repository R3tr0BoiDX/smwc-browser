# SMW Central Browser
Hey! Thanks for stopping by! Today, I bring you the [SMW Central Browser](https://github.com/R3tr0BoiDX/smwc-browser/)! 

## What is this?

Depending on your perspective, this can be several. Mostly, it's a handy tool to browser and search for [SMW hacks](https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&s=smwhacks) on [SMW Central](https://www.smwcentral.net/). This tool allows you to browse through all SMW hacks submissions, search with specific filters, lets you download and patch your SMW SFC file and launches the patched ROM with your favorite emulator!

From another perspective, a part of this project is a crawler (for the submission table-like pages as of right now), which allows you to interact with the submissions in a more developer friendly way. Maybe you want to build your own browser, then you might want to check out [this subfolder](source/smwc)!

This project was mainly created with the Steam Deck in mind, but should work on any platform, that supports Python!
## Install
There are two ways for you to install this. You can download precompiled binaries or clone this repo and run it from the source code!
### Precompiled binaries
You can get the [latest precompiled binaries](https://github.com/R3tr0BoiDX/smwc-browser/releases/latest) from the releases section from this project's GitHub page. Just download them and execute them! It's nearly that easy!
