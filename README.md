## Wanna help?

This project entirely in my free time next to my full time job. Soon, ill write my bachelor thesis and will have much less time for this project. So, if you wanna contribute and help with any feature, you're welcome! We need tests, bug fixes and new features would be nice as well. I much appreciate your consideration! :slightly_smiling_face:

Constructive criticism and ideas for improvements are also always welcome!

## Future ideas

(in order of importance)

- File browser for unzipped hack, if there are multiple patch files
  - Should include an option to show all files and apply them as patches if the user wishes so
- Wrapper and screen for hack entry site
- Wrapper for hack screenshots and display in browser
- Save filter parameter
- Maybe a way to delete downloaded hacks from library?
- Support for SMW2:YI and SM64
- Language support
